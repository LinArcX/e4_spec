A personal approach to controlling my life.

Tip: This is the improved version of [memento](https://github.com/LinArcX/memento).

## Qoute
> “Memory’s not perfect. It’s not even that good. Ask the police. Eyewitness testimony is unreliable. The cops don’t catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff. They collect facts, they make notes and they draw conclusions. Facts, not memory.”

## Definitions
- Time can divide into three era: _past_, _present_ and _future_.
- But era is more rebel that we can imagine. So we should trap it in more short-period boundaries. I call those boundaries: **TimeBoxes**
- From this point you just see timeboxes. There are no opaque words like past, present and future.
- For simplicity, we assumes each day is a separate TimeBox.
- You want to plan for your next project? It takes 12 days? No problem. just reserve some hours for 12 days.
- In Every day(TimeBox), you define your expectations(Daily schedule) from that day and your experencies that you got from that day.
- With this approach, you are forced to re-organize your mind every day!
- At the end of day, you can write in experiences, which things you got from that day. They are your outcomes of that day.
  They are treasures that you can use in your future days.
- you can score every of your experinces from a number between 0 - 5.
- Expectations can have **Priorities**.
- Past are just timeboxes that are less than today.
- **Experiences** are the outcome of timeboxes in the past.
- **Plans** are your filled future timeboxes.
- **Wishes** are just your pure idea that you want to do in future. Wishes can be transfrom to **Plans** by assigning days to them.
- But time is not always manageable.
- You can get sick. There may be an earthquake in your city. Or any other accidents that are beyond your control. How deal with them?
- So you should have **Buffers** in your timeboxes to deal with events.
- Assign a portion of your day to buffers.(something between 5% and 20% of day is reasonable)


## How use this approach?

The simplest way is to write your own timeboxes on a paper and start following them :)

But the better way is to transform this approach to a software. So if you're a programmer, you're free to implement this specification
in any kind of software form that you like. (A library, an android app, a desktop app, etc..)
